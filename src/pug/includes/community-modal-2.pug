                            p Held a workshop on how to do code review in academia. We started with an engaging introductory presentation that involved audience discussion and participation, covering the fundamentals of code review including what it is, the benefits, how to prepare your code for review and how to review someone elseâ€™s code. After a tea/coffee break, attendees put what they had learnt into practice and reviewed R or Python code snippets in pairs. In summary, it was a fantastic first event for this series, with some excellent discussions and participation from our attendees on code review in academia.
