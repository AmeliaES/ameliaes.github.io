                            p I recently discovered some really cool projects people had made using raspberry pi's and wanted to have a go at this myself. I wanted to create something that would be useful for me and decided on a simple LCD screen that could display the time my next local bus was departing. I also added a message to say when to leave, to walk quickly or to run depending on how many minutes there were until the next bus. If the bus was less than a certain number of minutes away then I would miss it if I left the house at that time, so instead it shows the next available bus I could get.

                                strong Data from the Lothian Bus API is fetched, wrangled and output to the LCD screen using a Python script that is scheduled to run every minute in a cron job on the Raspberry Pi.
