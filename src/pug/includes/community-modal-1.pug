                            p.item-skills Set up and lead a coding club - a friendly space to discuss coding problems, create and share resources and learn from each other.
                            p In our department, many individuals encounter similar coding challenges eg. data cleaning/analysis and using high-performance computers. Addressing these challenges together not only makes them less daunting but also enhances efficiency by reducing duplicate efforts through shared code and resources. Additionally, good coding practices are crucial for reproducible science. 
                            p(style="padding-bottom: 1rem;") The coding clubâ€™s primary aim is to foster a friendly, supportive environment for improving coding skills together. We focus on creating and sharing resources that benefit both our research group and the wider research community.
